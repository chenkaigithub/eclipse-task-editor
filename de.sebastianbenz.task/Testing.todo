Testing & Contious Integration:
	
	Creating a knowledge base:
	
		-  Testing frameworks
			- When to use which framework?
			- What tools are there?
			- References to Blog entries, articles
			- List of people with experience in these frameworks 
		- Best practices
			- How to test EMF based applications
			- Builders
			- Reusable matchers, provide matcher libraries
		-  Book recommendations

	Building a community:
		
		- Collect a list of people with experience in different testing domains
		- Encourage active knowlege exchange
		- Let people show what they are proud of
		
	Providing useful workflows:
		
		-  Build server integration
		-  Define testing workflows, e.g. together with a coverage analysis
	
Next steps:
		
		-  Setup confluence page
		- Define a publication schedule (either a newsletter or via blogpost)
		- Collect a list of initial contributors for testing frameworks
